# 🌞 Intro
**AnesBench** is designed to assess anesthesiology-related reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). 
It contains 4,427 anesthesiology questions in English. 
Each question is labeled with a three-level categorization of cognitive demands and includes Chinese-English translations, 
enabling evaluation of LLMs’ knowledge, application, and clinical reasoning abilities across diverse linguistic contexts.
